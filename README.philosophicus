### I. De Fundamentis (On Foundations)

*"Every line of code is a decision. Every decision shapes reality."*

The philosophy behind UCAN-DOS emerged from a simple observation: 
Technology without purpose is mere complexity. True system architecture 
begins not with choosing frameworks, but with understanding the human 
problem that demands solution.

### II. De Methodo (On Method)

The Cathedral and the Bazaar methodology teaches us that great software 
emerges from the intersection of:

- **Vision** (The Cathedral approach for architecture)
- **Community** (The Bazaar approach for implementation)
- **Purpose** (The Business approach for direction)

### III. De Systemate (On Systems)

A true system architect thinks in layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        BUSINESS LOGIC LAYER         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       TECHNOLOGY STACK LAYER       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         HUMAN INTERFACE LAYER       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer serves the one above it. The bottom layer serves humanity.

### IV. De Progressu (On Progress)

*"The goal is not to list skills, but to demonstrate a mindset."*

Progress is measured not in technologies mastered, but in problems solved.
Each project in the system logs represents a challenge accepted, 
a solution architected, and value delivered.
